This is my Proposal of the final project..

So initially, in the abstract section I can define that.. this project is for predicting the price of any given cryptocurrency for example Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC). Maybe I will talk about ( Ethereum Price Prediction for 2025: is Ethereum 2.0 Become a Game-Changer?

The data will be provided from Yahoo Finance which is one of the most reliable financial resource.

For the design, In this project  data from the Yahoo Finance API about the given cryptocurrency which is updated and fully Historical, then analyse that data with Machine Learning (AI). To our help, Python will contribute as the coding language and we will use several libraries for predicting Such as:

• Pandas for date manipulation and operations.

• Pandas data reader for reading data from a source e.g. Yahoo.

• NumPy for math operations and data organized.

• Matplotlib for visualization.

• TensorFlow for Neural Networks.

• Sklearn for processing data.
 
Also I may use Seaborn.

As far as the data section goes, the data will be provided by Yahoo finance API through for which we will use Pandas Datareader. This resource will give us the comparative price of the any given cryptocurrency with the US Dollar. Alongside that, we will get the past data of the cryptocurrencies as well for predictions like any quarter of the year which is another feature.
